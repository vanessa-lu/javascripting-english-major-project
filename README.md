Hello World
My name is Vanessa Lu and here are some of my personal goals for this project:
1) I want to learn how to successfully develop a website
2) I want to become more tech savvy and be able to create something of my own online
3) I want to bridge the connection between English and coding

## Hastings Street

Hastings Street was a major thoroughfare in the [Black
Bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bottom,_Detroit) neighborhood of
Detroit. It was largely razed to the ground to make room for the [Chrysler
Freeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Freeway).[^1]

[^1]: The Chrysler Freeway is part of Interstate 75, which, coincidentally,
was also why 5th & Mound was razed to the ground.
