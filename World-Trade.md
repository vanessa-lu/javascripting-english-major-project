The World Trade Center was a large complex of seven buildings located in the Financial District. It was best known for the landmark feature, the Twin Towers.

On the morning of September 11th, 2001, Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorists hijacked two Boeing 767 jets and flew them into the Twin Towers. Two hours after the attack, the towers collapsed, killing 2,600 people in and within the vicinity of the buildings.
