      <h1><i>Emperor's Children</i> by Claire Messud</h1>
      <p>In <i>The Emperor’s Children</i>, Messud traces the facades and realities of New York City’s modern elite. Set in months before the 9/11 attacks, the novel entwines the stories of three college friends at the cusp of their thirties, each hoping to make something meaningful and successful from their lives. The characters at the center of the novel, Danielle Minkoff, Marina Thwaite, and Julius Clarke, all emerge from one of the most prestigious universities with expensive tastes and the presumption of entitlement. Despite living lousy lives with no economic prospects whatsoever, the self-absorbed characters think of themselves as the cultural elite who will ‘shake up’ the world.

Two ambitious arrivals from outside of Manhattan upset the group’s stasis: Marina’s immature and idealistic college dropout cousin, Frederick “Bootie” Tubb, and Ludovic, an overly ambitious Australian who seduces Marina to gain entry to New York’s elite social circle (while setting plans to destroy her father’s reputation).

Altogether, these characters orbit Murray Thwaite, the ‘emperor’ of these children. He is the father of Marina Thwaite, and a hypocritical pompous journalist, who has been ‘skating on his reputation’ for decades.

<p>In this digital project, I will be analyzing what Messud’s geography of New York tell us about the social enclaves, socioeconomics of the novel’s time period. To execute this project, I will be using JavaScript and HTML to build online data repositories. Utilizing geographical data as a mode of storytelling will further strengthen my literary analysis.</p>

              <p> Mapping out each location associated with each character in The Emperor’s Children created a new inquires of the relationship between social enclaves, history of geography, and socioeconomics within the context of the novel:</p>
<p class="second-paragraph">
Question 1 - Geographically, we know where each character hails from. How do these places of origin influence each character’s current modes of thinking and behavior? Does current residence in New York City dictate </p>
<p id="third-paragraph">
Question 2 - Each of the characters resides in some of the most prominent and influential neighborhoods in New York including Chelsea, Upper West Side, Alphabet City, and Gramercy. Each neighborhood is classified by the type of people who live there and their socioeconomic status. What does the neighborhood that each character resides in tell us about the socioeconomics of early 2000’s era within the context of the novel? </p>
<p class ="fourth-paragraph">
Question 3 - The 9/11 attacks served as a pivotal point in not only in the novel, but also in U.S. history. How did the terrorist attacks change/reveal each character? Have the attacks changed each location mentioned in the novel and more importantly, the overall geography of New York?
</p>
<p class ="fifth-paragraph">
Question 4 - Noticeably, Messud makes no mention of ethnic enclaves such as Harlem, Chinatown, Bedford Stuyvesant and Washington Heights in New York in the novel. The novel comprises of solely white intelligentsia. Why does Messud choose to exclude characters of color in the novel when Manhattan is known as melting pot of culture and ethnic diversity? What is she trying to imply about about African American, Latino, and East Asian intelligentsia at this era?
