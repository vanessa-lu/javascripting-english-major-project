 Marina Thwaite resides in W 80th Street, which is part of the Upper West Side. Marina is one of the gorgeous 'It girls' of New York, who has never really accomplished anything in her life. She grew up living in her father's shadow, thus she often feels the pressure to live up to her father's standards as a professional writer. She spends most of her time trying to finish her book, *The Emperor's Children Have No Clothes*.

 Her father, Murray Thwaite, is one of most reputable journalists of New York. Underneath the lavishness and glamour, he is an old pompous hypocrite, who recycles tired out maxims. He also is an unfaithful husband and a serial adulterer.


With rent averaging around $3,400/month, The Upper West Side is one of the more expensive neighborhoods of New York City. The quiet neighborhood is a mix of Columbia graduates, young wealthy professionals, and families. The Upper West Side is best known for its extravagant and expensive pre-war apartment buildings
